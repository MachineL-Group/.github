# Sign Language Learning Application

## Overview

Communication is a crucial aspect of daily life. For individuals with hearing and speech impairments, sign language serves as a primary means of communication, allowing them to interact with the world around them. However, learning sign language can be challenging due to limited access to resources and lack of interactivity, making the learning process less effective and engaging.

To address these challenges, we have designed _SignEase_, a technology-based application that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to assist individuals with hearing and speech impairments in learning sign language. By using gesture recognition technology, SignEase provides an interactive and enjoyable learning experience for its users.

_SignEase_ is a machine learning-powered application designed to assist individuals with hearing and speech impairments in learning sign language. The application utilizes video classification to interpret sign language gestures and provides users with interactive lessons and feedback. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, SignEase aims to make learning sign language accessible, engaging, and effective.
